To compile this project, do the following in your commandline:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This will create the following files:

hash_std      - std::unordered map
hash_original - unchanged baseline solution
hash_a        - solution of task a
hash_b        - solution of task b

You can use (e.g.) "make hash_a" instead to recompile a single file only.

To try the evaluation script:
1. first execute all executables you just created at least once
2. execute the r script (eval/make_plots.R) for example
   e.g. by entering "Rscript make_plots.R" into a command line
