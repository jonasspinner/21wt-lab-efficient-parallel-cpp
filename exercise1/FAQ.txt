There were two errors in our original ./pq/tests/correctness.cpp:
 - CanInsertAfterPop-test did insert more than capacity elements
 - The OPTIONAL_OnlyMoves test for the addressable priority queue
   expected an empty table

Copy Free change_key
 - the OPTIONAL_OnlyMoves test for the addressable priority queue
   cannot be successful without changing the interface of change_key
   function. If you want to implement a change_key that supports copy
   avoidance then change the change_key function, to receive the new
   key by value (hence being able to move the initial input).

Also a small update to the pdf:
 - mostly because we changed the interface of the priority queue, to
   allow for copy-free push without using an emplace function.
