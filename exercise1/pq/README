To compile this project:
1. install the gtest library
   e.g. sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
2. if you used a non-standard install path, you
   have to enter the path into the CMakeLists.txt
   file
3. do the following in your commandline

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This will create the following files:

pq_std - std::priority_queue
pq_a   - solution of task a
pq_b   - solution of task b
pq_c   - solution of task c
pq_test - this test checks for the correctness of your implementation

You can use (e.g.) "make pq_a" instead to recompile a single file only.
