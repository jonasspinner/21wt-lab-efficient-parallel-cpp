* We do not have a general correctness test for the concurrent queue and container
You could/should implement a couple of correctness checks to your
microbenchmarks (task of 4.1.c). We did not implement a general test
because it would dictate the overall structure of the benchmarks.

* The Tree and DAG tasks are somewhat self-checking
Both generate errors, if you try to work on a task which is not yet
ready to execute (i.e. has unfinished predecessors). This should also
work for larger graphs. We have a set of general task Graphs that can
be downloaded.  Additionally you can use the generators found in the
tools folder, to generate additional graphs.
