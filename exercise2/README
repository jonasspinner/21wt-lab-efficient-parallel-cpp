FAQs

Q: Are the graphs directed?
A: Yes.

Q: Can I assume node IDs will always be in [0, num_nodes)?
A: Yes.

Q: What should I do in the beginEdges/endEdges functions?
A: The goal behind these functions is to provide a consistent
   interface for all implementations.
   The intended use is like this:

   for (auto it = graph.beginEdges(node); it != graph.endEdges(node); ++it) {
       const auto neighbour = graph.edgeHead(it);
       // ...
   }
