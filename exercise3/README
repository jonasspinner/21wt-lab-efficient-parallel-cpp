To build:

makedir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

To generate data (for the correctness test) unpack the included zip
file (it should create the data/folder).  Afterwards, the data folder
contains two graphs and two datasets that you can use to test the
correctness of your solution. Use build/test_correctness to test the
correctness of your solution.  For your experimental evaluation
(performance tests) you may/should also test your solution on other
graphs generated with our graph generator.

DO NOT UPLOAD THESE DATA SETS INTO YOUR GIT REPOSITORY
(SCC has previously called us about our overblown data usage)

To generate additional graphs (for your tests) compile the
graph_construction target and run the resulting executable
the necessary parameters are:

build/graph_construction  <#components> <#nodes avg_degree> [#nodes avg_degree...]

Where <#components> is an integer (number of components). For each
component there should be a pair of <#nodes> which is the number of
nodes in the component (integer) and <avg_degree> (float>1) which is
the average degree of nodes in the component. Different components of
the resulting graph are loosely connected. Do not generate components
with "very" large average degrees.

../build/graph_construction 6 100 2 100 1.2 100 2.5 100 1 100 2 100 2.8 >> test_graph1.graph

generates a graph with 6 components, each of which has 100 nodes with
varying average degrees (between 1 and 3).
